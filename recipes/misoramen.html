    <h1>Miso Ramen</h1>
    <h2>You can make my delicious Miso Ramen with authentic broth at home in 
        less than 30 minutes! Add optional ramen eggs and chashu (Japanese 
        braised pork belly) or customize it with your favorite toppings. 
        It's a piping-hot bowl of soulful goodness that's sure to satisfy 
        your ramen cravings.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ginger</li>
        <li>1 shallot</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the ramen toppings ahead of time—a day in advance for the 
            Homemade Chashu (Japanese Braised Pork Belly) and Ramen Egg 
            (Ajitsuke Tamago)—so they're ready to serve with your piping-hot 
            bowl of ramen.
        </li>
        <li>
            For toppings, I add chashu, ramen egg, blanched bean sprouts 
            (or Spicy Bean Sprout Salad), frozen or canned corn, Shiraga 
            Negi (julienned long green onions), chopped green onion/scallion, 
            and a sheet of nori (dried laver seaweed). You can find their 
            recipes in the hyperlinks. For the optional condiments, prepare
             a bottle of la-yu (Japanese chili oil), pickled red ginger 
             (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga), and some white pepper
              powder on the table.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gather all the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mince or press 2 cloves garlic (I like this garlic press) and add 
            to a small plate. Then, grate the ginger (I use this ceramic 
            grater) and add ½ tsp ginger (grated) to the plate.
        </li>
    </ol>
