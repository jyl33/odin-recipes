    <h1>This classic soup gets its richness from meltingly tender braised beef.</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons neutral cooking oil (such as vegetable oil), divided</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless beef shank, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds or 2 pounds oxtails (about 3 large)</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high until shimmering, about 1 minute. 
            Working in 2 batches, arrange beef slices in a single layer, and cook, undisturbed, until slightly browned on 
            bottom, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer browned beef to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil to pot; reduce heat to medium-low. Add garlic, scallions, chiles (if using), 
            and ginger. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant and garlic cloves are lightly browned, about 2 minutes. 
            (Be careful not to burn garlic; reduce heat to low, if needed.) Stir in rock sugar and chili bean sauce; cook, 
            stirring occasionally, until sugar melts, 2 to 4 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes; cook, stirring occasionally, 
            until tomatoes cook down and mixture thickens, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add rice wine to pot; bring to a boil over medium-high, stirring to scrape any browned bits from bottom of pot 
            using a wooden spoon. Add water, soy sauces, salt, and Chinese five spice; return beef to pot. Place Sichuan 
            peppercorns and star anise in cheesecloth, a satchel, or tea ball; add to pot. Bring mixture to a boil over 
            medium-high; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover pot, and simmer until beef is meltingly tender but slices remain 
            intact, 2 hours to 2 hours, 30 minutes. Season with additional light soy sauce, if desired. Remove cheesecloth, 
            and discard.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide noodles evenly among 6 bowls. Ladle broth evenly over noodles. Arrange beef slices evenly over 
            top (if using oxtails, take meat off bones and shred). Serve with scallions, greens, and chile crisp; serve 
            immediately.</li>
    </ol>
