    <h1>Pho</h1>
    <h2>I've had many bowls of pho in my life, and then I had the one that blew 
        everything else out of the water. It was made by Aunty Jacqueline, my 
        mother in law's childhood friend from Vietnam where the two of them 
        grew up together. Her beef pho (pho bo) recipe was so much richer, 
        more flavourful and fragrant than everything I've had from a 
        Vietnamese restaurant here.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lb beef bones, joint or marrow bones preferred</li>
        <li>1 lb brisket or chuck, if using chuck, cut into 1-inch thick slabs</li>
        <li>1.5 lb oxtail, optional, see note</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the bones, oxtail and stewing beef thoroughly under tap water 
            and place into the stock pot. Cover with 4L of water and bring to 
            a simmer. (If the water doesn't fit in your pot, you can top it 
            up later after it has reduced.)

        </li>
        <li>Place the ginger and the onion halves, cut side up, on a baking 
            sheet, and place under the broiler for about 10 minutes, or until 
            the onions are slightly charred. Slice the broiled ginger lengthwise
             into a few pieces, or smash it with a pestle until broken.

        <li>Toast the spices: Add the cinnamon stick, star anise, black cardamom, 
            and green cardamom into a dry skillet and toast over high heat for a 
            few minutes, moving the pan constantly, until the green cardamom browns
             slightly. Remove from the pan, then reduce the heat to medium and add 
             the coriander seeds. Move the pan constantly until they darken slightly 
             - this should take less than a minute. Remove from the pan.
